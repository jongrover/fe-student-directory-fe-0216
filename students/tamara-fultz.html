  <div id="bio">

    <p>I received my B.A. in classical languages (<a href="http://www.psu.edu/">Penn State</a>) and did graduate work in information studies (<a href="http://drexel.edu/">Drexel University</a>) and art history (<a href="http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/main/">Hunter College</a>, <a href="http://www.gc.cuny.edu/Home">CUNY Graduate Center</a>). I have worked as a museum librarian at the <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> for 15 years. Every fall semester I teach an online metadata class at <a href="http://www.rutgers.edu/">Rutgers University</a>. I currently reside in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, near the murky depths of the Gowanus Canal.</p>

  <div id="hobbies">

    <p>I am an avid reader with extremely eclectic tastes from reading histories of WW1 to feminist authors, such as Terry Castle, to sci fi such as The Expanse series, to detective novels by Elizabeth George. I suppose you could call my cats, Diego and Leon, a "hobby", since they are certainly a time suck. I love tooling around attempting to  learn stuff like XML, Python, and Ruby.</p>

    <h3>Sculptor of Tyana</h3>

    <pre class="poem">
      As you’ll have heard, I’m no beginner.
      I’ve handled a lot of stone in my time,
      and in my own country, Tyana, I’m pretty well known.
      Actually, senators here have also commissioned
      a number of statues from me.
       
      Let me show you
      a few of them. Notice this Rhea:
      reverential, all fortitude, very old.
      Notice Pompey. And Marius here,
      and Paulus Aemilius, and Scipio Africanus.
      The likeness as close as I could make it.
      And Patroklos (I still have to touch him up a bit).
      Near those pieces of yellowish marble there
      stands Kaisarion.
       
      And for some time now I’ve been busy
      working on a Poseidon. I’m studying
      his horses in particular: how to shape them exactly.
      They have to be made so light
      that it’s clear their bodies, their legs,
      are not touching the earth but galloping over water.
       
      But here’s my favorite work,
      wrought with the utmost care and feeling.
      This one—it was a summer day, very hot,
      and my mind rose to ideal things—
      this one came to me in a vision, this young Hermes. 
    </pre>
